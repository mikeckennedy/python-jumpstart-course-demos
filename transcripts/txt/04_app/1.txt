0:00 It's time for app number 4
0:01 and this time we are going to build a daily journal, or a diary. 
0:04 So let's look at what we are going to build, what it's going to look like.
0:07 Here is the output we are going to expect from our app
0:10 you can see as always there's a header
0:12 notice there is a few diagnostics messages there 
0:14 saying we are loading our data from a file 
0:17 and at the end you can see saving to a file. 
0:20 So one of the primary focuses of this app is on File I/O
0:24 and you can see the main part of the app gives you this menu
0:26 and says what do you want to do
0:27 list your journal entries, add a new one or exit. 
0:30 And if we hit "L" you can see we are listing out a few items
0:33 if we add one it gets appended 
0:35 and we persist this across running instances of the app, in our file.
0:40 While that may sound pretty straightforward
0:42 we are actually going to cover a ton of topics. 
0:44 We are going to break our application into multiple Python files 
0:47 and use them between each other.
0:49 We are going to talk about this thing called live templates in PyCharm, 
0:52 as I already said we are going to focus on File I/O.
0:55 We are going to work with the most common type of loop in Python
0:58 called the for-in loop. 
0:59 We are going to talk about documenting our code with these things called docstrings.
1:03 We are going along with File I/O and talk about how we manage
1:06 file paths and combine file paths segments in a platform independent way.
1:11 We are also going to talk about how we define methods
1:14 and how we can structure our code so that we can sort of
1:17 define them in what order makes sense
1:19 and then use them in any order we'd like. 
1:21 And last but not least,
1:23 we are going to talk about complex conditional expressions
1:25 we've been working with very basic conditionals before,
1:29 but we'll get a little more involved in this one as well.
