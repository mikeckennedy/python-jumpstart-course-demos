0:00 Docstrings are a core concept of this application, 
0:02 let's look at it in detail. 
0:04 So here we have some method, 
0:05 and we saw that if you just put a string at the beginning of a method 
0:09 on its own line without assigning it to a variable, 
0:12 that becomes the docstring.
0:14 The recommendation is to use three double quotes
0:16 and separate this so it's nice and readable onto new lines 
0:20 we saw that there is actually a format to talk about 
0:23 the various parameters as well as the return value.
