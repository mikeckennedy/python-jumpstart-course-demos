0:00 That brings us to our final core concept, 
0:03 this __name__ variable, 
0:07 or sometimes referred to as __name__.
0:10 So we saw this __name__ variable is available in all modules and Python scripts,
0:15 and the convention is it's set to the name of the file,
0:19 if the file is being imported, 
0:22 otherwise it's set to __main__.
0:25 __main__, right?
0:27 And we use this trick or this convention to determine 
0:31 how our should execute. 
0:33 In our example we decided do we run the main method in the event loop
0:37 or do we just define the functions and actually skip running the main
0:40 because we are not the program
0:42 we are just being used by another program.
