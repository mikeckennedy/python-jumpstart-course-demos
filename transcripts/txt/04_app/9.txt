0:00 Let's come back to our event loop for a moment. 
0:02 So when I run this app, I can list the items, 
0:05 and I can an add an entry and hit exit, 
0:08 but if I hit like enter, you can see I get kind of this weird 
0:11 like hey we don't understand nothing, 
0:14 maybe I'd like an empty entry that just mean 
0:16 hey let's just exit, save and exit, 
0:18 so we can change our code really quickly here, 
0:21 first of all, let me change this to be something 
0:23 other than a non-existent empty pointer, Ok?
0:28 We want to come up here and we want to have 
0:30 a complex conditional that says 
0:32 when the command is not the x and it's not empty
0:36 so in many languages, you use symbols like the && 
0:42 or double pipe to say and and or, 
0:44 Python we just say and or or, 
0:48 ok, so if we want to say the command is not equal to x, 
0:52 and the command has some value in it, 
0:56 I could say like it's not equal to none, 
0:59 or the length is greater than 0, or something like this, 
1:02 but in Python remember the truthiness of collections and strings are collections
1:08 are if they are not empty then they are true, 
1:10 and if they are empty then they are false. 
1:12 Maybe that's a bad choice of words of being empty like this. 
1:15 Ok, so this will almost work if we run this, 
1:19 and when I say list then enter, 
1:21 it says we don't understand that and then boom, it exits.
1:24 So we need to add another bit down here, 
1:26 say if the command is not X, 
1:30 and there is some sort of command entered here, right, 
1:34 which is not empty, then save this error. 
1:37 If we wanted to say it's not X and there's nothing in here 
1:39 we would say and not command. 
1:41 Right, so there is ways to combine this with parenthesis, 
1:45 and all the boolean logic you can do in regular programming. 
1:49 All right, so here let's list the entries, 
1:50 and hit enter boom, goodbye.
