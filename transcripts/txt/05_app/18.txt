 0:00 Before we completely step away from our weather app
0:03 let's talk about the final concept virtual environments
0:06 recall, virtual environments allow you to create isolated
0:10 dedicated environments for a particular application
0:13 in there you have a copy of the Python runtime
0:16 and you have initially, basically no packages 
0:20 but you can use pip to install those packages 
0:23 and they won't conflict or battle with any of the machine wide ones
0:28 you just have only what you need in this nice clean environment. 
0:31 It helps you understand how you deploy to production
0:34 it helps you understand what requirements you want to tell other users to have 
0:38 they are going to run your scripts on their machines
0:41 now just creating the virtual environment is not enough
0:44 remember, you have to activate it so you change into the environment folder
0:48 and into bin, and you say .space activate on OS X or Linux 
0:52 and on Windows you just say activate
0:55 I believe it might be a batch file. 
0:57 But, you call activate and then your command prompt changes
0:59 your path changes so that all the Python tools like Python itself
1:03 pip and so on now run exclusively out of that environment.
