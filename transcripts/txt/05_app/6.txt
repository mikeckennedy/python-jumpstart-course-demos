 0:00 All right, let's work with pip a little bit. 
0:02 We all use pip to install the external packages from PyPi
0:06 that we need to finish up our app. 
0:08 First thing to do is ask which version of pip do you have, 
0:11 you can type pip and something will happen, 
0:14 but depending on the order on which you've installed Python 
0:17 the way your path is setup you may end up with pip 
0:20 that manages the packages from the Python 2 interpreter, 
0:22 or you may end up with pip 3 which manages the packages for Python 3. 
0:27 So you want to be very careful on ask which one do I have. 
0:30 It turns out you can see here I have the one from 3.5, 
0:34 before I installed 3.5 on OS X I believe I just typed pip I got pip version 2,
0:39 if you want to make sure you are working with pip 3 on OS X or Linux 
0:43 you can just say pip 3, and that will always give you 
0:46 either pip 3 or they will just fail, 
0:48 similarly for Python 2 you can always say pip 2, 
0:51 sometimes it's helpful to use the witch command to say which pip 3, 
0:55 or maybe which pip and it will actually show you that works on Unix base systems, 
1:01 on Windows the command is where pip, or where pip.exe
1:05 ok we saw that pip is actually the one we want, 
1:07 I am just going to be super explicit and say pip 3 for this. 
1:10 So the first thing to do is see what we have installed. 
1:13 Maybe we already have Requests who knows. 
1:15 So I can hit pip 3 list, and then this lists all of the packages
1:19 that are installed for my Python 3 interpreter. 
1:22 And you can see Request does not appear in the list, so let's fix that, 
1:26 notice it says we are using the old version of pip, 
1:28 we'll fix that in a moment, so let's say pip 3 install Requests. 
1:32 So if I hit go, you can see I have installed this before 
1:37 so it actually grabs a cashed local version instead of redownloading it, 
1:41 have they not installed it you would have seen download first, 
1:44 the cool little progress bar and then it would have gone and done this. 
1:48 While we are at it, let's talk about upgrading, 
1:51 so pip itself is installed as a package, 
1:53 it's very meta right, pip manages pip, and my pip is out of date, 
1:58 chances are your pip is probably out of date too, 
2:00 depending on how old your version of Python 
2:03 it may be really out of date, so I can say pip install pip and do and upgrade, 
2:08 chances are this is going to fail but let's try. 
2:11 So it failed and why did it fail- well, permission error 
2:16 cannot write to this library/frameworks/whatever, 
2:21 that's a system level location, 
2:23 so for this case we need to do sudo and enter a password, 
2:29 again on Windows that would be running a command prompt as admin. 
2:36 Excellent, so now we will get rid of that warning, 
2:39 we'll be sure to be using the latest pip 
2:41 the other package that we are going to need is Beautiful Soup. 
2:45 We'll talk more about what Beautiful Soup is 
2:46 but while we are here let's go ahead and install it, 
2:48 so we'll say pip 3 install beautifulsoup now be careful, 
2:53 there is beautifulsoup and a newer which is beautifulsoup4, this is one you want.
2:58 I already happen to have it installed, 
3:01 so let's see if there is an upgrade for it.
3:04 Nope, it's already up to date, I have the latest version, that's excellent.
3:09 So we are ready to use both, Requests and Beautiful Soup 4.
