 0:00 Now that we have this data downloaded form the internet, 
0:03 let's go and write it to our file. 
0:05 We want to save this data to a particular name 
0:08 related to the cat name in the folder that we pass 
0:11 so this should be pretty easy to write, 
0:13 we'll say save image and we'll give it the folder
0:16 we'll give it the name and the data. 
0:20 So down here we are going to have a method like so 
0:23 now you worked with files before and you know 
0:26 when you are just going to use the file stream just for a moment 
0:29 and then you are going to close it right away
0:32 you want to use what is called a context manager 
0:34 so we'll say with and open() is how we get all the file stream, 
0:37 and we want to give it a name so let's come up here 
0:39 and say file name = and again, we are going to use the os model 
0:42 so we'll say os and import that at the top, 
0:46 we'll say path.join() and our folder is in absolute path so that should work 
0:51 and then we have our name and then this is like the name of the cat 
0:55 like lol cat 1 lol cat 7, these are basically jpg's 
0:58 so let's just add on the file extension.jpg. 
1:02 So now we can say open file name and say as fout for output file stream, 
1:07 and then we are going to somehow work with this,
1:09 if I were to just write this code and try to write this data to it, 
1:14 this data is binary, this by default is a text file
1:18 it's not going to turn out so well for us 
1:21 so what we need to do is go over here and change the mode, 
1:23 and we can say I'd like to write, by default it's read only 
1:27 and I'd like to write not just text but binary 
1:30 so we'll set the mode to wb for write binary 
1:32 and then I could work with the output stream 
1:35 and the data stream and sort of copy those around 
1:37 and juggle the bytes and that would be fine 
1:40 but it turn out there is a module called shell util that will help us out here. 
1:45 So we'll say shutil, like so and we want to import that at the top of course, 
1:50 and it has a method called copy file object.
1:54 So we can say I would like to copy this data stream to that data stream, 
1:59 done, one line, beautiful. 
2:01 Now, PyCharm says you should really move your method down one line, 
2:04 according to pep 8 so there we go. 
2:07 All right, we are ready to run this app and get some cats 
2:09 but remember I told you on line 14, 15 here we are doing it wrong 
2:14 so let me run it, get some sort of not working images,
2:18 and then I'll show you how to fix it, it's really easy but it's also easy to overlook.
2:22 Let's make sure we get some output while we are running our download 
2:26 so we'll do a little print statement here, 
2:28 we'll say contacting server to download cats, 
2:33 and we'll say something like print downloading cat 
2:40 and then let's actually involve the name here, 
2:44 I'm going to say plus name, 
2:46 and then at the very end I guess we could print done, 
2:49 something like so so let's run it. 
2:56 Ok, how exciting, let's go look at our cats, 
2:58 so now you can see we have all of our cats and if I open them up, 
3:02 that's not a super cool cat, 
3:04 I love all cats and I was hoping for a good little laugh when I saw this picture, 
3:08 and this made me sad, 
3:10 well you might think there is a problem with PyCharm 
3:12 but in fact, if we actually open this up and find her you would see 
3:15 there is not really a proper picture there, 
3:17 so let's go back here and talk about the mistake 
3:19 we made when downloading binary data using requests
3:22 so in order to work with this raw stream here 
3:24 in the manner that we were doing it, 
3:27 we need to go tell request to operate in what is called streaming mode, 
3:30 so we can say stream = true, and now if we just rerun it 
3:33 you should see some nice cats. 
3:37 Ok, it's all done, let's go look at the cats. 
3:41 Nice, trash cat is not amused, but I am, because this is awesome, 
3:45 let's look at one more, uuu I'm in your quantum box, maybe. 
3:48 Ok, so perfect, we've downloaded our data using requests 
3:52 and we are working with the raw stream 
3:55 and we set stream mode to be true 
3:57 we then pass that stream over to our saved image 
4:00 which we create a binary file we can write to 
4:03 and we use the shell utility copy file object to copy from this stream to that stream. 
4:10 But as a user, how would I know my cats have been downloaded 
4:13 other than seeing done, ok, great, done, 
4:15 but I actually want to see the cats 
4:17 so the next thing we are going to do is show the cats to the user.
